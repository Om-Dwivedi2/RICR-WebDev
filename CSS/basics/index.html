    <h1 class="heading">My Country INDIA</h1>
    <p>India is the largest democratic country. 
        It is a big country divided into 29 states and
        7 union territories. These states and union territories
        have been created so that the government can run the country more easily. 
        India also has many different kinds of physical features in different 
        parts of the country that are spread over its states and union territories. 
        India is a very diverse country as well, which means that the people around 
        the country are different in many ways. Even though India is such a diverse place, 
        it is united as one country.
